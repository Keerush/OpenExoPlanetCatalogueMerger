-----------------------------------

Project Management:  __________ (40%) 36/40

  Release plan:  
    - each release corresponds to end of Sprint [1]
    - project fully laid out:
      for each release date, list of user stories to implement [1]
    - project velocity specified and used [-1]
    - highest priority user stories first modulo dependencies  [1]
    - reasonable goals for each release -1

    [4/5]


  Product Backlog:
    - user stories follow the correct format.
    - user stories, together, reflect all the user requirements (from
      all personas).

      peace" stories).

    [4/5]

  Sprint Backlog(s):
     - user stories taken from the Product Backlog
     - estimated costs
     - estimated values

     [5/5]

  Sprint Plan(s):
    - user stories divided into tasks when appropriate.
    - each Sprint Plan contains all the necessary information:
        who is working on which task on which day
    - sum of costs of user stories in the sprint = project velocity
    - good planning decisions

    [5/5]

  Use of Task Board:
    - correct format of task boards
    - snapshots in the begginning and end of each Sprint are provided

    [5/5]
    
  Use of Burndown Charts:
    - snapshots in the begginning and end of each Sprint are provided

   System Design:
      - good modular design

    [7/10] -3, I would like to see you expand more on the specific details on the Backend, Data Handler and Database.

   Implementation:
     - 0 marks if it doesn't run
     - at least one feature is either fully implemented of nearly implemented
     - quality and maturity of code

    [10/20], demo ran. Didn't do enough work to consider any feature to be finished.




Report: __________ (20%) 20/20

  - well-presented, is easy to read and to navigate
  - spelling and grammar
  - looks professional 
  - quality of the README file

Interview: ________ (10%) 10/10
Product backlog
Split up a couple of user stories, to target specific differences between catalogues. Split one into 4.

Satisfying

Sprint backlog
Had tasks to split up data fetching and csv conversion 
Understood how the process worked

Satisfying 

System design
Frontend and backend and database separation, named a couple api calls

Satisfying 

Task board and burndown 
Lost a member on day 3, reviewed assigned tasks and reworked the backlog so it could be done with users. Seems to have increase their productivity after losing a member.

Implementation
Was able to explain configuration, had a successful demo

Satisfying
